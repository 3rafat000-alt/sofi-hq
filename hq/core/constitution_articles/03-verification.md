# Article 03 — Verification (outcome over self-report)

Foundation: serves Teaching VI (Reversibility) and Teaching II (Hierarchical Flow). Read `02-grounding.md` first, then `hq/core/nexus/gates.yaml`.

## V1 — Outcome over self-report (mechanical)

A ticket marked `done` must carry an evidence block (command + output/exit code, file:line proof, or diff/log). Evidence is validated at the gate and bare "done" is rejected — fail-closed.

## V2 — Fresh-context adversarial verify

Before any gate advances: `gtw-gatekeeper` checks the diff/output against the ORIGINAL ticket criteria, never the implementer's reasoning. UNKNOWN is a valid verdict. For high stakes, route through the external review desk (`gtw-external-reviewer` — family-diverse judge, Teaching VII).

## V3 — Pass^k at Gates 5–6

Money/auth/PII paths heading to staging/prod: re-run critical check k times. Flaky correctness blocks the gate.

## V4 — Never gate an irreversible action on verbalized confidence

Ship/rollback decisions gate on behavioral proxies only (exit 0, artifact exists, k runs pass, rollback script tested). Never the model's self-rated certainty.

## V5 — Judges drift; sample the transcripts

Periodically spot-check the trajectory behind a PASS and behind a 0-finding report (brd-cqo owns the audit cadence).
