# SOFI AI Cross-Room Service Contracts

> **These contracts define the formal service relationships between rooms. Each contract is binding. A room that fails to meet its SLA may be escalated. These contracts descend from the Constitution and Protocols and cannot contradict them.**

---

## Contract Structure

Each contract specifies:
- **Service:** What is provided
- **Provider:** The room that provides
- **Consumer:** The room that consumes
- **Description:** Service details
- **SLA:** Service Level Agreement — time limits and quality bars
- **Handoff format:** How the service output is delivered
- **Dispute resolution:** How conflicts are resolved

## Contract 01 — Direction Setting

**Service:** Strategic direction and prioritization
**Provider:** 00-boardroom
**Consumer:** 01-strategy
**Description:** Boardroom provides strategic goals, market context, resource allocation decisions, and priority framework to strategy room. Strategy room executes within the defined boundaries.
**SLA:** Boardroom responds to strategy requests within 5 agent turns. Strategic directives issued in writing with measurable objectives. Vague direction → returned.
**Handoff format:** Formal directive via `RCCF` ticket with: PRJ-ID, strategic objective, success metric, resource envelope, time constraint, constraints list. Boardroom retains veto on strategy proposals.
**Dispute resolution:** Strategy escalates to brd-ceo. If brd-ceo is the source of dispute, escalated to board vote (3/4 majority). Resolution binding within 10 agent turns.

## Contract 02 — Research Informing Design

**Service:** User research, journey maps, behavioral insights
**Provider:** 02-research
**Consumer:** 03-design
**Description:** Research room provides validated user research (journey maps, persona insights, pain points, behavioral data) to design room. Design relies on research output as source of truth for all design decisions.
**SLA:** Research delivers within current session unless scope exceeds 10 agent turns. Research output must include: source data, methodology, key findings, journey maps, confidence level. Research without methodology → returned. Research output validity: 20 agent turns (after which re-validation required).
**Handoff format:** Research dossier via `RCCF` ticket with: `journey-map/`, `persona/`, `findings/` sections. All claims cite evidence (Protocol 03). Handoff triggers Gate-1 closure.
**Dispute resolution:** Disagreement on research findings escalated to gtw-conflict-resolver. If unresolved → brd-arbiter. Design cannot override research findings without boardroom approval.

## Contract 03 — Design Handoff to Frontend

**Service:** UI designs, design system tokens, interaction specs
**Provider:** 03-design
**Consumer:** 06-frontend
**Description:** Design room delivers validated designs, design system tokens, interaction specifications, and asset exports to frontend room for implementation. Frontend implements exactly what is designed — no creative interpretation.
**SLA:** Design delivers within current session for screens up to 5 states. Each delivery includes: Figma/HTML references, design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, motion), responsive breakpoints, interaction states (hover, focus, error, loading, disabled, empty). Design without interaction states → returned. Design validity: 30 agent turns.
**Handoff format:** Design package via `RCCF` ticket with: `screens/`, `tokens/`, `specs/` directories. Explicit handoff acceptance (P-02.4) triggers Gate-2 closure and Gate-4 readiness.
**Dispute resolution:** Implementation questions → dsn-lead responds within 3 agent turns. Disagreement on design fidelity → escalated to gtw-conflict-resolver → brd-arbiter. Frontend cannot modify design without dsn-lead approval.

## SLA Violation Escalation

| SLA Miss | First Offense | Second Offense | Third Offense |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| <2 agent turns late | Warning (Level 1) | Level 2 | Level 2 + CEO notified |
| 2–5 turns late | Level 2 | Level 2 + Lead notified | Level 3 + CEO review |
| >5 turns late | Level 2 + Lead notified | Level 3 | Level 3 + board notification |

**SLA clock starts** when handoff ticket is accepted by consumer room. **SLA clock pauses** when provider requests clarification and resumes when consumer responds.

## Conflict Resolution Between Contracts

If two contracts are in conflict:
1. Contract with higher-priority room (lower room number) prevails
2. If same priority: boardroom contract > security contract > quality contract > all others
3. If still unresolved: escalated to brd-arbiter → brd-ceo

---

*All contracts enforced through the hierarchy (Lead → CEO). SLA audit run at Gate-8 by brd-cqo. Violations logged to `hq/brain/amygdala-incidents.md`.*
